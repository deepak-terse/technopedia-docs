### **Description:**

---

It aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic *(thus the word “flex”)*.

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its item's width/height *(and order)* to best fill the available space *(mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes)*.
