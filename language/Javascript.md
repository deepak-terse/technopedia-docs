### **History:**

---

- Javascript was first introduced by Netscape as a part of the Netscape Navigator (web browser) release and was officially called as **LiveScript**. It was done by  collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language
- Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995 where they reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called **JScript**.
- In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first **ECMAScript** language specification in June 1997.
- In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International. Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008. In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the **ECMAScript 5** standard, released in December 2009.
- Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of **ECMAScript 6** in 2015
