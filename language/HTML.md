### **Description:**

---

**Hyper** in HTML means showing some extra information in the form of hyper links which will navigate you to another pages. **Markup** is just a way the computer understands how to process and present textual or graphical information.

HTML describes the structure of a web page. Once the html document is created, other things can be embedded into it - like JavaScript for adding interactivity and CSS for designing and placing the contents.

All the websites that we see on the internet are either designed in HTML or designed in some other language that generates an HTML code.

### **History:**

---

- **HTML** was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially.
- **HTML 1.0** was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
- Then comes the **HTML 2.0**, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
- Then comes the **HTML 3.0**, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
- Then comes the **HTML 4.01** which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML
- **HTML 5.0**, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.
