### **Description:**

---

CSS specifies the page-layout, color, font and the style of every component displayed on the website. It is responsible for the look and feel of the website.

<br><br>

### **History:**

---

- The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is **CSS level 1**, published on December 17, 1996
- **CSS level 2** specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998
- **CSS level 2 revision 1**, fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification. After multiple iterations and reviewing, it was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.
- Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.
