Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of classes and objects. It works on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**Coined By:** Alan Kay in 1967

### **Description:**

---

The primary purpose of object-oriented programming is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of programs. Object oriented programming brings together data and its behaviour(methods) in a single location(object) makes it easier to understand how a program works. All the OOPs concepts are based on the 2 basic fundamentals - Classes and Objects.

An **Object** represents a physical entity which holds the data associated with it.

A **Class** is a template which defines the properties of this object and its behaviour.

### **4 Main Principles:**

---

**#1: Encapsulation**

> It means wrapping data and code together in a single unit and hiding the implementation details of an object, i.e. how an object does something and make it accessible using a single object.

**#2: Abstraction**

> It lets you define a method or class in its abstract form so that it could be reused i.e. to define only that information that is required at that particular point.

**#3: Polymorphism**

> It simply means to have more than 1 form i.e. one word can have different meaning in different contexts.

**#4: Inheritance**

> It is the ability of the object to acquire the properties and behaviour of its parent object.
